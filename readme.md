# Stream One Project
 
## Overview

Fall Out Boy Fansite
 
### What is this site for?
 
This is my final project for Code Institute Stream One. The Example page can be found here: https://placeholder.com

I am not affiliated with the band Fall Out Boy at all. I am just another fan and this page is for example purposes only, NOT profit. All
band information is from either their wikipedia pages or the bands actual website. I hope you enjoy my first web project.
 
### What does it do?
 
This app will allow users to check the bands latest news, listen to the bands music, and view the latest band videos. You can also sign up for
the bands newsletter.

Load the page, and browse the pages using the top navigation.
