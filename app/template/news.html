      <p>This is our love letter to Chicago. Lake Effect Kid EP out now https://fanlink.to/lakeeffectkidep Ex-US might be a sec until you see the EP up.</p>
      <p>16 days until weâ€™re back to the city we grew up in, playing the biggest headline show weâ€™ve ever played before in Chicago. Still so unreal that weâ€™re playing Wrigley Field on September 8th ðŸ˜³ <a href="https://youtu.be/k4Yd3nnreOo">hereâ€™s a vid</a> with a glimpse at all the madness throughout the years - go <a href="http://cubs.com/falloutboy">get your tickets</a> to the show so we can continue getting lost in this crazy dream with you.</p>
      <p>We decided to start the party early by opening up the M A N I A Experience before the show starts on Saturday. We teamed up with so many incredible artists to help bring the album to life in a completely different lens, so get your cameras ready. There will be 12 different spaces for you to walk through (everything from a giant purple wave, to a room with music boxes filled with unreleased remixes and covers, + more). Frosty and Royal Tea will be there, in the fur, ready for some photo ops. Also gonna have a pop up shop with limited edition merch specific to the experience and Wrigley, giveaways and other fun along the way. Who knows what could happen.</p>
      <p>The M A N I A Experience will be open on September 8th and 9th. Tickets will be free and you can RSVP starting on Tuesday, but more info coming soon.</p>
